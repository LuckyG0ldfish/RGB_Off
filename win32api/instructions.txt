This script assumes that you have connected your RGB lights to the specified pins.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. turn_off_rgb.py) and run it using the python command. For example:

python turn_off_rgb.py

This will turn off your RGB lights. If you want to turn them on again, you can modify the script to set the output pins to True instead of False.

Note: You may need to install the win32api library in order to use this script. You can do this by running the following command:

pip install win32api
